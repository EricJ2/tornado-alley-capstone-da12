Focus on urbanization in previously rural parts of Tornado Alley.\nEvaluate Tornado Destructiveness:\n\nIdentify trends in the destructiveness and fatality rates of tornadoes over time. Focus on economic losses and fatalities using historical records from FEMA and NOAA.\nCompare where the most destructive tornadoes (both in economic damage and death toll) are happening now versus historical patterns.\nStudy Climate Change Influence:\n\nExplore how climate change might be contributing to the shift in tornado patterns. Analyze temperature, humidity, and wind shear changes over the decades and correlate them with tornado formation zones.\nPredictive Modeling for Future Tornado Paths:\n\nCreate a predictive model that forecasts future tornado-prone regions based on historical data and weather patterns.\nEvaluate if urban centers in previously lower-risk zones might be at increasing risk of tornadoes in the future due to the shift.","remarkDisplay":true},"objectClass":"NSArray"},"text":"capstone"},"objectClass":"NSArray"},"children2":{"0":{"objectClass":"MindNode","ID":"G1M5O","children":{"0":{"objectClass":"MindNode","ID":"4P291","text":"1. Disaster Declarations Summaries\nThis dataset can help you analyze trends in tornado-related disaster declarations over time, which could be a good indicator of whether tornadoes are affecting more populated or more destructive areas.
